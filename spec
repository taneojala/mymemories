First:
- RDF presentation of TIME which is completely generic
- covering point in time, period (start TIME, end TIME) , precise TIME (datetime), unprecise TIME (e.g. year, month-year, season-year, 
decade, century)

TIME can then be used by persons (foaf), events (historical events, myMemories)

PLACE is needed as well: lat-long, place name, hierarchy needed: country - city - ... + lat-long
